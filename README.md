## The Novel COVID-19 Virus

  Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respitory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first case was identified in Wuhan, China early in December 2019. In about three months, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic after it spead to numerous countries around the world within this short timespan. By October 2020, this devestating virus had infected around 40 million people and killed 1.1 million worldwide. 
  Due to the severity of this disease, scientists and researchers worldwide have been continuously working in order to create an effective vaccine to promote protective immunity in individuals. In December 2020, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) reported that about 2.8 million people had recieved an initial vaccination in the United States.

## The Effect of COVID-19 World-Wide

## Current Status of COVID-19 Vacccine

## COVID-19 Vaccine Tracker Application

  Our goal with this application is to create an interactive global map that shows the progress of distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine. By utilizing an up-to-date [repository](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data) from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/), we are able to show the most current progess of vaccine distribution from countries around the world. It is our hope that by promoting this information in an intuitive and easily accesible way that people can be more informed about worldwide policies and effects of COVID-19 vaccine distribution.

## Statement of Purpose 
As the world saw in the beginning of the pandemic, COVID-19 is greatly impacting the envionment. For example, natural disasters have been more difficult to handle due to the virus. But, becuase of the need to quarentine, the air quality in many countries has increased quickly. Now that the vaccine is rolling out around the world, it is important to be educated on each country's progress and current state. Staying informed on the vaccine distribution can help predict the next stages of the virus, and what envionments it will be most likely to be active in. Informing people about the state of the vaccine rollout across the world is the purpose and goal of this vaccine tracking project.
